  The Kiev 30

<h2 id="the-second-love-of-my-life">The second love of my life</h2>
<p>I got the Kiev 30 for Christmas last year and it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>Me and father dearest got into <em>(and in his case back into)</em> 16mm photography with a Minolta-16 P and he decided to gift me an hold Kiev 30 in pretty much mint condition.</p>

<p>The Kiev 30 is a pretty blatant copy of the original Minolta-16 although it has
a single feature wich blows the Minolta-16 <strong>OUT OF THE WATER</strong></p>

<em>Manual Focus</em></p>
<p>Althought this seems quite well ... the baisic feature which is taken for granted on almost every camera most of the sub-miniature cameras that Minolta produced do not have a manual focus (with the exception of the Minolta MG) whith most of the cameras having a fixed focus, and the original Minolta-16 not even focusing to infininity and requiring an expesive and now rare lense to be usable for lanscape photograpy.!</p>

One of my favorite parts of the camera is the view finder as it quite litterall
is just a piece of glass with no magnification just kinda placed at the front of the camera :3, so it just kinda serves mors of an asthetic purpose
