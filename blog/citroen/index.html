<p>A while back now I got to test drive a Citroë Ami with my dad and I have some opinions on the experience.</p>
<p>Firstly it's <strong>CUTE</strong> in the looks the department with it being built like a hamster. The interior is laking in most modern luxuries such as a radio or speaker system, with the expectation of bringing your own entertainment. The Drive Reverse Parked and Neutral buttons in our model being placed on the left hand side of the driver seat making it a bit uncomfortable to change gear. All of this in my opinion would be great for a silly little two seater since it would be lovely for someone and a partner to zip around a city... If it was fast enough. The Ami only goes at a snails pace of 27 mph (45 km/h), this in the uk is UNACCEPTABLE as most residential areas are 30 and only rencently some <em>small</em> towns have moved to 20 mph. In my opinion is my main gripe with the car as you are a moving road hazard blocking road traffic if you even attempt to leave your town / city. The second issue is the price of the Ami since for the same price of the ami, you can buy a hybrid Fiat 500 which is a better car in every aspect compared to the ami.</p>
<p>It's quite sad that the ami is just slow since if it went even 35 or even 40 mph it could be useable on country roads.</p>
