  Going vegeterian for a month
</h1>
</header>
<p>During October I dedcided to have a little fun and change up my diet to see how life was as a vegeterian.
I'd say im normaly not much of a meat eater when it comes to my normal diet, but I will admit it is quite nice every once and a while, therfore the change to vegeterianism didn't go too badly.
The onething that did get me was the amount of quite unasuming things that actually have animal products e.g., gummy sweets such as Liquorice Allsorts (which I was quite disappointed that I couldn't eat :( )
The thing I found most surprising was that I started thinking more actively about what I was eating compared to before I started the "chalenge" (To be honest it was the best thing).</p>
