  Migrating to git.gay
</h1>
</header>
<p>A few weeks ago I realised that my funds in my linode account were running out and I didn't really wan to continue paying for it so I decided to move to a static site provider.
After doing zero research and just going to the first thing that popped in my head I dedcided to move to git.gay, since I wanted to try something new :3.</p>
<p>I also rememebered that there was a section for automatically deploying to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/codeberg-pages/">codeberg pages</a> automatically with <a href="https://www.getzola.org">Zola</a>, which allows you to push to a repo and have your site automatically built and pushed to the pages branch so it's automatically hosted.</p>
<p>For some reason I am either really stupid, can't read or the documentation is outdated (tbh probably a mixture of all 3), but the .woodpecker.yml just didn't work so I just learn't how to use the build system for forgejo and made my <a href="https://git.gay/crumpet/sitesource/src/branch/main/.forgejo/workflows/site.yaml">own</a>, which just pushes to a repository called pages after building your site using Zola running in an Alpine linux container.</p>
<p>I'm also migrated some of my repos that where on sourcehut to <a href="https://git.gay/crumpet">git.gay</a> so everything is in one neat place.</p>
