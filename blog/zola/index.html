  Site rewrite
</h1>
</header>
<p>After an afternoon of work I have completely migrated to a ssg called <a href="//www.getzola.org">Zola</a>!</p>
<p>I mainly did this since I never actually learnt how to use hugo and wanted to have some more controll on how my pages were generated ;3.</p>
<p>I also plan to add more sections to my site soon^tm and with zola it seemed a lot easier to do that!
Thankfully it isn't too hard migrating content from hugo to zola so the hardest part was really just getting my head around how templates worked (since I just modified the css for the lukesmith hugo theme for my last site!).</p>
<p>Since I'm on holiday right now I have the time to set up my super secret page this week :3, so stay tuned!</p>
